# ARMageddon: Cache Attacks on Mobile Devices
https://github.com/oscarg933/AutomatedLab.git.patch
This repository contains several libraries and tools to perform cache-attacks on
the mobile devices. The published code has been used to perform the most
powerful cross-core cache attacks [Prime+Probe](https://eprint.iacr.org/2005/271.pdf), [Flush+Reload](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/448.pdf), [Evict+Reload](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity15/sec15-paper-gruss.pdf), [Flush+Flush](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04594) on non-rooted ARM-based devices without any privileges.

We have developed this libraries and tools in the [ARMageddon: Cache Attacks on Mobile Devices](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions/presentation/lipp) paper and used it to build covert-channels that outperform state-of-the-art covert channels on Android by several orders of magnitude. We utilized it to implement [cache template attacks](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity15/sec15-paper-gruss.pdf) that monitor tap and swipe events as well as keystrokes, and even derive the words entered on the touchscreen. Moreover, we used it to attack cryptographic primitives in Java and to monitor cache activity in the ARM TrustZone from the normal world.

The [ARMageddon: Cache Attacks on Mobile Devices](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions/presentation/lipp) paper by Lipp, Gruss, Spreitzer, Maurice and Mangard has be published at the Usenix Security Symposium 2016 and presented at [Black Hat Europe 2016](https://www.blackhat.com/eu-16/briefings/schedule/index.html#armageddon-how-your-smartphone-cpu-breaks-software-level-security-and-privacy-4887).
